# Exercise 7.16
#  Consider the triangle shown below. This triangle houses a colony of Tri-
#  angle Crawlers, and one big Eater of Triangle Crawlers. The Eater is located
#  in point D. All Triangle Crawlers are born in point A. A Triangle Crawler
#  which ends up in point D gets eaten.  Every day, each Triangle Crawler moves
#  over one of the lines to a randomly-determined neighboring point, but not to
#  the point where he was the day before. This movement takes one day. For
#  instance, a Triangle Crawler that was just born in A, on the first day of
#  his life will move to B, C, or D. If he moves to B, the next day he will
#  move to C or D (but not back to A). If on his first day he moves to C
#  instead, the next day he will move to B or D (but not back to A). If he
#  moves to D, he gets eaten.

#  There is a one-third probability that Triangle Crawler on the first day of
#  his life immediately goes to D, and therefore only lives one day. In
#  principle, a Triangle Crawler may reach any age, however high, by moving in
#  circles from A to B to C and back to A again (or counterclockwise, from A to
#  C to B and back to A again). However, since every day he makes a random
#  choice between the two possible follow-up directions, every day after the
#  first there is a one-half probability that he ends up in point D, and dies.
#  Write a program that calculates an approximation of the average age that a
#  Triangle Crawler reaches. Do this by simulating the lives of 100,000
#  Triangle Crawlers, counting the days that they live, and dividing the total
#  by 100,000. The output of your program should be a single floating point
#  number, rounded to two decimals.

#  Hint 1: You can follow two different approaches: either you simulate the
#  behavior of one single Triangle Crawler and repeat that 100,000 times, or
#  you start with a population of 100,000 triangle crawlers in point A, and
#  divide these over variables that keep track of how many Triangles are in
#  each point, each day, including the point that they came from (assigning a
#  remaining odd Triangle Crawler to a randomly determined neighboring point).
#  The first method is short and simple but slow, the second is long and
#  complex but fast. You may use either method.

#  Hint 2: Do not use 100,000 Triangle Crawlers in your first attempts. Start
#  with 1000 (or even only 1), and only try it out with 100,000 once your
#  program is more or less finished. Testing is much quicker with fewer
#  Triangle Crawlers. 1000 Triangle Crawlers should be done in under a second,
#  so if your program takes longer, you probably have created an endless loop.

#  Hint 3: I wonâ€™t be too specific, but the final answer is somewhere between 1
#  and 5 days. If you get something outside that range, it is definitely wrong.
#  You may try to determine the exact answer mathematically before starting on
#  the exercise, which is doable though quite hard.

# We can't use the choice() method, because it hasn't been introduced yet,
# so we can use numbers to represent positions: 1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, 4 = D
